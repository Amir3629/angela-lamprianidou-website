  const description = `Angela Lamprianidou offers transformative choreographic experiences that explore the intersection of movement, presence, and human connection. These immersive encounters go beyond traditional performance, creating spaces where bodies speak, remember, and shift together.

Each experience is carefully crafted to open new pathways of perception and connection. Through guided movement, breath work, and somatic exploration, participants discover layers of themselves that were previously hidden or forgotten.

The experiences range from intimate one-on-one sessions to group workshops, each designed to meet participants where they are. Angela's approach combines her background in dance, dentistry, and somatic research to create unique methodologies.`;

  const additionalInfo = `Available Experiences:

Pure - A choreographic experience centered on human contact, vulnerability, and the raw essence of connection. Created in 2017 for the Let Me In Festival, performed at the Goethe-Institut in both Berlin and Madrid.
