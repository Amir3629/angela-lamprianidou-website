A workshop with Matti Melchinger 
and Angela Lamprianidou 

In the workshop "Against the Zeitgeist" we go into the search 
for truthfulness in communication. How do I transform myself 
before, during and after a crisis, or a pandemic experience 
as we are currently experiencing it, How can we create creative 
potential in a time of supposed perfection through the incompletion.`;

      Which tools are necessary to be able to reproduce true feelings in words and movements in this world ?  
      <br />In our daily life and in our artistic enviroment.
      <br /><br />
      By combining their two techniques, which have been developed over many years of experience, Lamprianidou and Melchinger accompany you through this two-day workshop. We go in a search of the natural breath, the flowing body, our own voice - the direct word into the momentum. We experience the moment as a simple yet radical and focused devotional state in our life.
      <br /><br />
      Through the combination of Jaw Release, Linklater Technique, Yoga, Choreography and acting exercises, we go through the four levels from breath to body to voice.
      <br /><br />
      Angela Lamprianidou (choreographer, dancer, dentist, life&jaw coach) 
      <br />and Matti Melchinger (actor, director, lecturer in speech training) 
      <br />offer for the first time a mixture of performing arts techniques 
      <br />for all people, both in their own lives and on stage want to deal 
      <br />with the incomplete against the zeitgeist.
