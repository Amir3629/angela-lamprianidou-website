We expand? Where do we expand, which spaces 
and spatial possibilities do we have?
How is the connection between the inner and outer space?
Voice is meeting movement - movement is meeting you.
The connection between the object and the subject?
A melange of somatic sensing, choreography and 
pranayama will accompany this workshop.

Did you ever have thought and felt though, in, in between, 
over and so on to the themes you want to invite in youÂ´re life? 
I designed a  workshop where there is space to do so.`;
