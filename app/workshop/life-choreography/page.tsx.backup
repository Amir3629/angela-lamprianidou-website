Life choreography is an artistic invitation 
to connect the inner space with the outer space.
"The way you breathe (inside), things can happen outside"

Breathing as a vehicle of space.

Choros (GR) means space, what we need so that something grows, expands.

Graphie (GR): The writing, choreography, the written in space.`;

        <p>We write with the whole body and create space, more space, 
more awareness, more creativity.</p>
        <p>The jaw acts as the first point of relaxed communication in these spaces.</p>
        <p>According to my jaw release method, which brings all articulations of the body 
and organs together with the jaw and lets it release old tensions, I invite you 
to experience the space that you creative people want to implement differently.</p>
        <p>In a relaxed state, you plan better and can decide 
more clearly what is really important to you!</p>
        <p>Life choreography is a change, a different approach in life 
to invite what fulfills you.</p>
        <p>Sensing, rhythm, real time improvisation, breathing 
and other choreographic skills are taught.</p>
        <p>I am looking forward to this blend of life, being alive, jaw and creation!</p>
