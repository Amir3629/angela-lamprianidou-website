An ensemble of professional dancers and a young 
drop of refugees invites to dance and illuminates 
the structures of integration: what does it mean 
to integrate into a society or a situation?

An empty, undisturbed hall becomes a meeting place.
Nations, stories and people meet. The audience itself 
gets an integration into the performance, 
assumes predetermined movements of the dancers 
and takes in own, which in turn is taken over.

Integration takes place on the same level. The dance 
functions as a universal language that does not have 
to be explained. The body speaks for itself.`;
