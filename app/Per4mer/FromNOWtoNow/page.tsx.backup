  const description = `It begins in the pause —
between inhaling and exhaling.
That fleeting stillness where nothing is held, and nothing is remembered.
Just now.
From Now to Now is an invitation to experience presence through space, body, and perception.
This experimental performance unfolds as a journey — one that guides you through different spaces, both physical and inner. With each shift in environment, your body listens, responds, transforms. You are asked to slow down, to notice what arises when you truly arrive in the moment.`;

  const additionalInfo = `It can take many forms:
– as a one-on-one encounter, where attention becomes intimate and heightened
– as a choreographic experience shared in silence or motion
– or as a workshop, where the now is explored collectively through simple practices of awareness
This work does not seek to entertain or explain — it invites you to feel.
Because you can only feel the now when your senses are clear.
Because being present is not a concept — it's a sensation.`;
