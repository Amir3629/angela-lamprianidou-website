Tanz Tanz sonst sind wir verloren

She is Hellas. Choreographer Angela Lamprianidou moves between her various identities (Spanish, German and Greek) and enters into different realities. Angela was born in Germany, her origins are Greek, and she has lived in Barcelona for the last 11 years. This combination of identities means she can flow between the three geographic and/or mental states.

Using Greek mythology and traditional Greek dance, she establishes a dialogue between her biography and current politics. Us and the polis.`;
