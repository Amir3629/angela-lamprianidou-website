  const description = `Ballett for bloody beginners is a participatory dance performance.
Everyone can be guided to take a position, show posture and be touched 
gently or delicately.
A choreographic experience that invites you to experience ballet with 
its strict positions differently.
We place special emphasis on the correct arm positions.
We rehearse until the coordination work between arm, head and foot work 
has been realised.
Excellent execution is rewarded or punished through various gestures.`;

  const additionalInfo = `In the light of ballet, we tell a story together, which is also allowed 
to be fun.
Special features of this experience: I am allowed to touch you, 
punish you, encourage you and be strict, if you don't want that, 
you are not allowed in the ballet.
