In back to emotion, A. Lamprianidou is proposing a performance which is based on a personal interactive meeting with a one-person audience. Disassociating herself from the distance we're given in a common stage. Because of this the performance will take place not in a theater or on a stage, it will happen in her own flat. This is a big challenge not only for the audience but also for the performer herself.`;

  const additionalInfo = `What will happen ? 
Anything or everything ? 
Cava or champagne ? 
Marc Almond or Andrew Williams ? 
Dance me dance you dance we ?

No press allowed, 
no mobile phones.`;
