  const description = `El cuerpo de otro refers to the sensuality and 
usage of one's own body and that of the other one. 

A puritan and effective escenography, in which different 
reactions of the body are described, will allow you as 
spectators, create your own stories starting 
with thoughts about your own bodies.

  const additionalInfo = `Her studies of dentistry helped her this time to put us into a world at the same time real and fantastic.
A theory is created that the teeth itself is a body.
Its characteristics are comparable with our own physic and like the maxilla fits into the mandibula, one body fits into the other one.

A performance that certainly doesn't let you go home without you having touched a part of your body, and hopefully you will have someone to practice with.
