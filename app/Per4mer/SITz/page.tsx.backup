  const description = `"SITz" declines the paradox of a dynamic world that exists beyond any possibility of occupying the upper quarters of erect stance, still seeking its dance, the paradigm of its unsteadiness.

Sitz is the fickle, and thus never-ending, dance of the homo sedens, who typically based his vision of history on a basic contrast between erect actors and a sitting audience, between doing and watching, starring and "witnessing"

For that very reason, the social and cultural protocols of sitting (and their perverted choreographies) are of special concern to women, the comprimarie (and almost forcefully the biological audience) of a rather macho history.`;
