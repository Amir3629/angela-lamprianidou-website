  const description = `"Dance as a social movement" is a research
project, that wants to go beyond the original
attempts to remove the "fourth wall": it goes
in the search of new techniques of
improvisation and new methods of mediation
to break the boundaries between ensemble
and audience and to transform them. In this
way, the stage can become a place of social
movement and encounters.`;

  const additionalInfo = `Angela Lamprianidou has already broken
the boundaries between Performers and
Audience in her Choreographic experience
Tanz Hin Tanz her.
Now she is interested in arrange dance
movements as a "break" of work school,
learning etc – in general institutions:
A call for dance.

Supported by Fonds Darstellende Künste with funds
