  const description = `"Hello, It's Me" (ta panta rhei) explores the question of how seniors are perceived in our society. In a cross-generational ensemble, people over the age of 70 collaborate to artistically express their experiences and emotions. Under the direction of Angela Lamprianidou, a piece is created that presents the older body as an equally valuable and important perspective in dance and performing arts.`;

  const additionalInfo = `It challenges society to make space for older individuals, to listen to their voices, and to acknowledge their presence.

The piece invites the audience to overcome generational boundaries and think together about an inclusive future where everyone experiences participation and respect.
