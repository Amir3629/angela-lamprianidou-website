  const description = `When was the last time you flirted — not just with words, but with silence, with stillness, with the space between? Flirt In is a playful, performative workshop — a sensual laboratory of communication and body language. A space to explore, together: How do you flirt? Do you flirt at all? Or are we all flirting, all the time — without even knowing it? We play. We arrive. We observe, experiment, transform. We flirt without words — standing, walking, with a glance, a tilt of the head, the flick of hair. We flirt with language — gently, boldly, teasing, whispering. Vertically. Horizontally. Truthfully. Fictionally. What does it mean to move closer — without crossing a line? How much distance does desire need? And what does a "yes" sound like — without a single word?`;

  const additionalInfo = `Flirt In is a space for curiosity, for play, for deep connection.
For anyone who wants to sharpen their senses, awaken their body's intelligence —
and (re)discover the delicious art of flirting.

This Laboratory of Flirting can be experienced as a full three-day workshop — or a one-day playful immersion.`;
